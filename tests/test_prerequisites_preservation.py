"""Preservation property tests for the prerequisites 404 bugfix.

Bugfix spec: .kiro/specs/basics-prerequisites-404-fix

Property 2 (Preservation): every request that does NOT match the
`/api/prerequisites/*` contract must behave EXACTLY as it does today. The fix
(mounting a new prerequisites router) is purely additive, so it must not change
any existing route, the root/health endpoints, the app's normal unmatched-route
404, or global middleware (CORS, rate limiting).

Methodology (observation-first): the assertions below encode behavior OBSERVED
on the CURRENT (unfixed) app. They are EXPECTED TO PASS now (capturing the
baseline) and must CONTINUE to pass after the fix (proving no regression). No
application code is modified by this task.

isBugCondition(request): path matches
    /api/prerequisites/{slug}/content
    /api/prerequisites/{slug}/answers
    /api/prerequisites/{slug}/answers/{rowId}
This file exercises the complement: `NOT isBugCondition(request)`.

Validates: Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
