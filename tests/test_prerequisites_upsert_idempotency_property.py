"""Property-based test for per-user upsert idempotency.

Feature spec: .kiro/specs/per-user-prerequisites-persistence (task 3.3)

Property 2: Repeated submissions for one member do not duplicate
    For any Member, Q&A slug, and Row_Id, submitting an answer any number of
    times results in exactly one Answer_Record for that (user_id, slug, row_id)
    triple, holding the most recently submitted answer.

Validates: Requirements 1.2

The property drives PUT /api/prerequisites/{slug}/answers/{row_id} through the
FastAPI TestClient with a real Bearer token (identity is resolved server-side
from the token), submitting a non-empty sequence of answers for a single
(member, slug, row_id). It then asserts, via a direct DB session, that exactly
one PrerequisiteAnswer row exists for the (user_id, slug, row_id) triple and
that its answer equals the last value submitted.

State isolation note: the conftest ``client`` fixture is function-scoped and
recreates the DB per test, but ``@given`` runs many examples inside a SINGLE
test function (one DB). Each example is made self-isolating by generating a
unique row_id per example and deleting the row it wrote at the end of the
example, so state never leaks across examples. Function-scoped-fixture health
checks are suppressed as recommended by Hypothesis for this pattern.

The row count is inspected through the SAME session the app uses (the
``db_session`` fixture, wired into the app via the conftest ``get_db``
override) rather than a second connection, so there is no SQLite lock
contention and results are deterministic.
