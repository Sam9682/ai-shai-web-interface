"""Access-control integration tests for seeded documents.

Feature: docs-auto-seed-and-documents-page
Task 4 — Validates Requirements 5.2, 5.3:

  - 5.2: A ``members``-level seeded document is visible to a Registered_User
         (a MEMBER) via ``GET /api/documents``.
  - 5.3: An Anonymous_User is denied download of a seeded document (403).

These tests exercise the real document API through the ``client`` fixture
(which overrides ``get_db`` with the in-memory ``db_session``). The seeded
document is produced by the actual seeding worker ``_seed_single_file`` so the
Document row (access_level=MEMBERS, admin-owned) and its Stored_File are real.

Storage is isolated by monkeypatching the module-level
``storage_service.upload_dir`` singleton at a ``tmp_path`` before seeding; the
document router imports that same singleton, so the file resolves globally for
the member download path.
